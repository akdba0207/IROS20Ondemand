Before being appointed in Bonn, he was a lecturer at the University of Freiburg as well as with the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. The research activities of the Photogrammetry and Robotics Lab focus on probabilistic techniques in the context of mobile robotics, navigation problems, and visual perception. The lab has made several contributions in the area of SLAM, localization, place recognition, autonomous exploration and planning, semantic interpretation and covers ground vehicles as well as UAVs. The two main application areas of the lab are agricultural robotics and autonomous cars. Cyrill Stachniss has coauthored over 220 scientific publications, he was senior editor of the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters as well as associate editor of the IEEE Transactions on Robotics. He is a Microsoft Research Faculty Fellow and received the IEEE RAS Early Career Award in 2013. He is actively participating in German and European research projects. He is spokesperson of the DFG Cluster of Excellence “PhenoRob - Robotics and Phenotyping for Sustainable Crop Production” at the University of Bonn. Furthermore, he acted as coordinator of the EC-funded project “ROVINA” for digitizing the Roman catacombs with robots and as the spokesperson of the DFG research unit “Mapping on Demand”. Besides his university involvement, he co-founded three startups: Escarda Technologies, DeepUp, and PhenoInspect.
