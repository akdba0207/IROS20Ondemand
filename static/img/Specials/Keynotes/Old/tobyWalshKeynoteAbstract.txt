An ICRA 2020 Keynote by Toby Walsh. In 2007, Noel Sharky stated that "we are sleepwalking into a brave new world where robots decide who, where and when to kill". Since then thousands of AI and robotics researchers have joined his calls to regulate "killer robots". But sometime this year, Turkey will deploy fully autonomous home-built kamikaze drones on its border with Syria. What are the ethical choices we need to consider? Will we end up in an episode of Black Mirror? Or is the UN listening to calls and starting the process of regulating this space? Prof. Toby Walsh will discuss this important issue, consider where we are at and where we need to go. In 2015, he helped launch an open letter calling on the UN to regulate fully autonomous weapons that made headlines around the world. Since then, he has spoken multiple times at the UN in New York and Geneva, and to politicians and the public around the world about these important issues.
