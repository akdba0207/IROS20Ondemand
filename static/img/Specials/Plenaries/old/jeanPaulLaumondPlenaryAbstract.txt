The purpose of the presentation is to show how from the 1990s robotics has integrated techniques from geometrical control (optimal control, differential flatness) to automate the computation of the movements of mobile robots subjected to the nonholonomic constraint of rolling without slipping. We will present both the problems solved and the questions still open today. In a second step, we take a pluridisciplinary perspective combining robotics, neurophysiology and biomechanics to better understand the geometry of bipedal locomotion.
